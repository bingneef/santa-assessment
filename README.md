# Santa Admin

This is a Rails 5.2.1.1 app.

## Documentation

* Staging and production deployment instructions are in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Prerequisites

This project requires:

* Docker
or
* Ruby 2.5.0, preferably managed using [rbenv][]
* MySQL must be installed and accepting connections

## Getting started

### bin/setup

Run the `yarn setup:docker` or `yarn setup` script. This script will:

* Create local copies of `.env`
* Create, migrate, and seed the database

### Run it!

1. Run `yarn rspec spec` or `rspec spec` to make sure everything works.
2. Run `yarn start` or `foreman start` to start the Rails app (and other dependent processes if present).
